/* Data structure -> arrays:
Store friends names in variables -> so could use later in program. */
/* Knowledge so far, this is how we'd do it */
const friend1 = "Michael";
const friend2 = "Steven";
const friend3 = "Peter";

/* Imagine if wanted to represent 10 friends, would need 10 variables. 
Instead wouldn't it be good to bundle all of values together into a bigger 
container. */

/* Thats why we have data structures like arrays in javascript */

/* Data structures like arrays. Arrays are big containers, throw 
variables and later reference them */
