/* when we learned about if else statements, comparison operators, 
boolean values, we also need to learn about logic - in particular boolean logic. */

/* boolean logic -> true and false values to solve complex logical problems */
/* most basic boolean logic: the and, or & not operators */

/* Example to utilise:
A: Sarah has a driver's license
B: Sarah has good vision

A and B 
"Sarah has a driver's license AND good vision."
true when ALL are true - no matter how many variables.

A or B
"Sarah has a driver's license or good vision."
true when ALL are true and if one is true

Not A, not B 
inverts true/false value
