/* JavaScript = high level object oriented, multi paradigm programming language */
// high level - don't have to think about memory management whilst javascript runs our program
// object oriented - mostly based on objects, for storing most kinds of data
// multi paradigm - flexible, can use different programming styles like imperitive and declerative
// programming language - tool instruct computer to do things

/* Web Development? */
// HTML = content of page - text, images, buttons
// CSS = presentation of content - styling, laying out elements on webpage
/* JavaScript  = programming language - allows developers dynamic and interactive effects to any webpage.
Also use it manipulate the content or CSS, load data from remote server and build entire applications 
in the browser - we then call web applications. */

HTML = nouns - <p> paragraph
CSS = adjectives - p { color: red }; describes the noun. means the paragraph text is red.
JavaScript = verbs - p.hide(); means hide the paragraph - doing something so is a verb.

JavaScript = dynamic effects and web applications in the browser - front end,
and web applications on web servers. node.js - run backend applications. run on web server, 
interact with databases. javascript - native mobile applications - react native.

/* value = piece of data, fundamental unit of info in programming. i.e. Jonas is a value */
/* whatever the operation could be summarised as below would be value, cause value is smallest 
unit of information */

/* values can be stored into variables - to be reused over and over */
/* let firstName = "Jonas"; is declaring a variable. */

Conventions for naming varaibles:
camelCase - means that whenever have multiple words in a varaible name, write first name with lowercase, 
next words with uppercase.
