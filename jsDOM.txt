GUESS MY NUMBER 

/* Selecting a html element in javascript */
/* query selector basically a method on document object */
/* into querySelector -> need to pass in a selector. This selector 
is exactly the same selector we would use in CSS. Pass string. */
console.log(document.querySelector(".message"));

/* querySelector selects the element, then on element can read textContent property. */
/* Multiple dot operators are executed from left to right */

WHAT'S THE DOM AND DOM MANIPULATION

/* JavaScript interacting with webpage -> DOM manipulation */
/* DOM = Doucment Object Model -> Structured representation of HTML docs. */
/* DOM lets JavaScript access HTML elements and styles and manipulate them */

/* Change text, HTML attributes and even CSS styles */

/* Document is a special object we have access to in JavaScript */

/* This object serves as an entry point into the DOM. cause need document to
start selecting elements */

/* DOM tree has more than just element nodes -> has nodes for texts itself, comments */

/* Whatever is in HTML document has to be in DOM */

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECTING AND MANIPULATING ELEMENTS

/* Besides getting text content, can set content to something else */
/* below we will do it by writing = then whatever we want the new content to be */
document.querySelector(".message").textContent = "Correct number";

document.querySelector(".number").textContent = 13;
document.querySelector(".score").textContent = 10;

/* input field where inputting data - use value property */
document.querySelector(".guess").value = 23;

HANDLING CLICK EVENTS

/* Lets make application do something when click on check button */
/* First time our code reacts to something that happened in the DOM. For 
this, use event listener. */
/* Event = something that happens on the page. Mouse move, key press etc. */
/* Event listener - wait for event to happen then react to it. */

/* To listen for events, first need to select event where the event 
should happen. */

/* So, in guess my number - want to listen to event on check button. This is where the 
click that I'm interested in will happen. */
/* so selecting element with class check */
/* on check element, addEventListener. */

/* addEventListener METHOD, first pass in type of event. - this case click. */
/* Second argument - tell eventListener what to do. Do that by specifying a function. */
/* Function will contain code that should be executed when click event happens -> 
its called the event handler. */
document.querySelector(".check").addEventListener("click", function () {
  /* in function argument body, specify what should happen */
  const guess = Number(document.querySelector(".guess").value);
  console.log(guess, typeof guess);

  /* if no guess? use !guess check if value is falsy If guess is falsy (such as 0, NaN, null, undefined, ''), 
  !guess will be true, indicating that there is no valid guess. */
  /* Remember any argument in an if statement parentheses will be evaluated to a boolean. and the
  argument is evaluated to see if it is TRUE */
  if (!guess) {
    document.querySelector(".message").textContent = "No number";
  }
});

/* Conceptually, remember a function is just a value. If a function is just a value, we
can pass it into another function as an argument. Like any other value, like a string or number. */

/* note we don't call the function the is a second argument of addEventListener. We 
only define the function, then pass it into an eventHandler. It is the JavaScript engine that 
will call the function as soon as the event happens. */
