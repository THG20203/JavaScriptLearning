Post-Increment (variable++):
This operator first returns the current value of the variable and then increments it by 1.
Example:
let x = 5;
let y = x++;

console.log(x); // Output: 6
console.log(y); // Output: 5

- In the line let y = x++;, the post-increment operator (x++) means that the current
value of x is assigned to y, and then x is incremented by 1.
- So, when you execute let y = x++;, the following sequence of events occurs:

1. y is assigned the current value of x, which is 5.
2. After the assignment, x is incremented by 1.

Therefore, after these steps, x becomes 6, but y retains the original value of x, which was 5.

                                     Pre-Increment (variable++):
This operator first increments the value of the variable by 1 and then returns the updated value.
Example:
let a = 10;
let b = ++a;

console.log(a); // Output: 11
console.log(b); // Output: 11

In this case, both a and b end up with the value 11 because a is incremented 
before its value is assigned to b.
